## Console Application on Simplan

Simplan Console is a simple console application that can be used to run operators as a console application. It can be used to run any non-data operators which doesn't need an execution engine as a simple java application.
If you can express your operator as a java class, you can run it as a console application using Simplan Console.

Example Superglue uses Simplan to schedule all its pipelines with databricks.
