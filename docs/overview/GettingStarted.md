#Getting Started

Simplan is a framework for defining an execution plan for operators that can be executed on different execution engines
like Spark, Flink, Storm, Beam or even run as a simple console Application. It provides a common abstraction to define
pluggable operators for processing both batch and streaming data and run on different execution engines with ability to
integrate with various source/sinks.
There are different execution engine implementations of Simplan available. Please select the following link to get
started with the execution engine of your choice.
